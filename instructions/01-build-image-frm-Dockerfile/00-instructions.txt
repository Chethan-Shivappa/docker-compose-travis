when we need to build an image from a Dockerfile
issue the folling command

[cmd]
docker build .

which means find a Dockerfile in the current dir and use that file to build an image.

==================================================================================================
but when we need to build an image from a file which is not named "Dockerfile" exactly
then issue the folling command

[cmd]
docker build -f file_name .

which means use the provided file_name to build an image.
